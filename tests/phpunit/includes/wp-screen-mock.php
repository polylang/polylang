 * Used to create mocks for {@see WP_Screen} because this is class declared as final.

 *
 * WP_Screen has a few behaviour we don't want to trigger in our tests :
 *  - it registers itself in the $wp_current_screen global variable upon instantiation.
 *  - it triggers hooks
 *
 * Inspired by @see https://gist.github.com/DragonBe/24761f350984c35b73966809dd439135
