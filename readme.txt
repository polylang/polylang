Go multilingual in a simple and efficient way. Keep writing posts, creating categories and post tags as usual while defining the languages all at once.

== Description ==

With Polylang fully integrated to WordPress and using only its built-in core features (taxonomies), keep steady performances on your site and create a multilingual site featuring from just one extra language to 10 or more depending on your needs. There is no limit in the number of languages added and WordPress’ language packs are automatically downloaded when ready.

= Features =

Depending on the type of site you have built or are planning to build, a combination of plugins from the list below might be of interest.
All plugins include a wizard allowing to setup them in just a few clicks.

### Polylang

Polylang and [Polylang Pro](https://polylang.pro) share the same core providing features such as:

* Translating posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, custom post types and taxonomies, RSS feeds; RTL scripts are supported.
* The language is either set by the language code in URL, or you can use a different sub-domain or domain per language.
* Automatic copy of categories, post tags and other metas when creating a new post or page translation.
* Translating menus and widgets.
* Customizable language switcher available as a widget or a navigation menu item.
* Compatibility with Yoast SEO.

### Polylang Pro

Helps optimizing the time spent translating your site with some very useful extra features such as:

* Better integration in the new Block Editor.
* Language switcher available as a block.
* Language options available in the widget block editor.
* Template parts translatable in the site editor (FSE).
* Duplicate and/or synchronize content across post translations.
* Improved compatibility with other plugins such as [ACF Pro](https://polylang.pro/doc/working-with-acf-pro/).
* Share the same URL slug for posts or terms across languages.
* [Translate URL slugs](https://polylang.pro/doc/translating-urls-slugs/) for categories, author bases, custom post types and more...

### Polylang for WooCommerce

[Add-on](https://polylang.pro/downloads/polylang-for-woocommerce/) for the compatibility with WooCommerce which provides features such as:

Neither of them will allow to do automated translation.
